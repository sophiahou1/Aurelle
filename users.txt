I recommend reviewing your expenses and finding ways to reduce them or finding ways to increase your income. Having $900 in savings is a good start for emergencies, but ideally, you should aim to have at least 3-6 months' worth of living expenses saved up in an emergency fund. Since your risk tolerance is listed as $900, keep in mind that risk tolerance typically refers to the amount of volatility or risk you are comfortable with in your investments. It's important to align your investments with your risk tolerance to ensure you are comfortable with potential fluctuations in the value of your investments.

By implementing these strategies and staying committed to your financial goals, you can work towards building a stronger financial foundation and achieving financial stability.
