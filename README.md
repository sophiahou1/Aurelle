# Aurelle

## Meet Aurelle, your AI-powered financial assistant 
Aurelle was designed to make money management simple and accessible. We know finance can feel overwhelming in today’s fast-paced, connected world. That’s why our platform is designed ‘for the girls’—empowering women everywhere to take control of their finances with confidence.


## Why Aurelle?
Our personal experiences with struggling with managing our finances, especially as college students, inspired us to make a budgeting app. There also aren't really many resources online that offer personalized tools, such as an AI-powered assistant and an expense budget tool that can also make the process of budgeting easier with a friendly UI/UX.


## How we built our project
 We built it using Python and Flask for the backend and HTML/CSS for the frontend. 

## Challenges Faced
Some challenges we encountered were setting up our environment since some of us were having issues cloning the GitHub repository, being on the correct version of Python, and installing imports. We also had a challenge getting the chatbot to give consistent and useful responses, prompt better questions, and add our own drawings and visuals. These challenges, although frustrating, made it all the better when we got the website fully functional and a smooth front end. 

## What we learned along the way
This project was the first time any of us worked with website frontend and backend development, so in this journey, we learned a lot. Aside from the technical side of learning to work with html, css, flask, python, etc., we learned not to be intimidated by our lack of knowledge. There is an abundance of information out there that allows us to pick up what we need to know really quickly. We learned that persistence and determination can get us a long way, and we learned to be able to lean on each other for support. 

## The future of Aurelle
 We want Aurelle to offer an even more personalized experience where Aurelle can use your financial data to generate visuals and graphics. We would love to be able to link to banks and investment accounts to get even better insight into how we can help our users and help our users have a smoother experience where they don't have to manually input all their information. We want Aurelle to be a one-stop shop for all things financial management.
